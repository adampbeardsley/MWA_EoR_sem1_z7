	Abstract = {The Murchison Wide-Field Array (MWA) is a low-frequency radio telescope, currently under construction, intended to search for the spectral signature of the epoch of reionization (EOR) and to probe the structure of the solar corona. Sited in western Australia, the full MWA will comprise 8192 dipoles grouped into 512 tiles and will be capable of imaging the sky south of 40$\,^{\circ}$ declination, from 80 MHz to 300 MHz with an instantaneous field of view that is tens of degrees wide and a resolution of a few arcminutes. A 32 station prototype of the MWA has been recently commissioned and a set of observations has been taken that exercise the whole acquisition and processing pipeline. We presentStokes I , Q , and U images from two ~4 hr integrations of a field 20$\,^{\circ}$ wide centered on Pictoris A. These images demonstrate the capacity and stability of a real-time calibration and imaging technique employing the weighted addition of warped snapshots to counter extreme wide-field imaging distortions.},

@article{Lorimer:2007,
	Abstract = {Pulsar surveys offer a rare opportunity to monitor the radio sky for impulsive burst-like events with millisecond durations. We analyzed archival survey data and found a 30-jansky dispersed burst, less than 5 milliseconds in duration, located 3{\textdegree} from the Small Magellanic Cloud. The burst properties argue against a physical association with our Galaxy or the Small Magellanic Cloud. Current models for the free electron content in the universe imply that the burst is less than 1 gigaparsec distant. No further bursts were seen in 90 hours of additional observations, which implies that it was a singular event such as a supernova or coalescence of relativistic objects. Hundreds of similar events could occur every day and, if detected, could serve as cosmological probes.},

@article{Pober:2015,
	Abstract = {We present constraints on both the kinetic temperature of the intergalactic medium (IGM) at z = 8.4, and on models for heating the IGM at high-redshift with X-ray emission from the first collapsed objects. These constraints are derived using a semi-analytic method to explore the new measurements of the 21 cm power spectrum from the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER), which were presented in a companion paper, Ali et al. Twenty-one cm power spectra with amplitudes of hundreds of mK 2 can be generically produced if the kinetic temperature of the IGM is significantly below the temperature of the cosmic microwave background (CMB); as such, the new results from PAPER place lower limits on the IGM temperature at z = 8.4. Allowing for the unknown ionization state of the IGM, our measurements find the IGM temperature to be above ≈5 K for neutral fractions between 10% and 85%, above ≈7 K for neutral fractions between 15% and 80%, or above ≈10 K for neutral fractions between 30% and 70%. We also calculate the heating of the IGM that would be provided by the observed high redshift galaxy population, and find that for most models, these galaxies are sufficient to bring the IGM temperature above our lower limits. However, there are significant ranges of parameter space that could produce a signal ruled out by the PAPER measurements; models with a steep drop-off in the star formation rate density at high redshifts or with relatively low values for the X-ray to star formation rate efficiency of high redshift galaxies are generally disfavored. The PAPER measurements are consistent with (but do not constrain) a hydrogen spin temperature above the CMB temperature, a situation which we find to be generally predicted if galaxies fainter than the current detection limits of optical/NIR surveys are included in calculations of X-ray heating.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT. We describe an ``active'' antenna system for HF/VHF (long wavelength) radio astronomy that has been successfully deployed 256-fold as the first station (LWA1) of the planned Long Wavelength Array. The antenna system, consisting of crossed dipoles, an active balun/preamp, a support structure, and a ground screen has been shown to successfully operate over at least the band from 20 MHz (15 m wavelength) to 80 MHz (3.75 m wavelength) with a noise figure that is at least 6 dB better than the Galactic background emission-noise temperature over that band. Thus, we met the goal to design and construct a compact, inexpensive, rugged, and easily assembled antenna system that can be deployed many-fold to form numerous large individual ``stations'' for the purpose of building a large, long wavelength synthesis array telescope for radio astronomical and ionospheric observations.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we report new limits on 21 cm emission from cosmic reionization based on a 135 day observing campaign with a 64-element deployment of the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization in South Africa. This work extends the work presented in Parsons et al. with more collecting area, a longer observing period, improved redundancy-based calibration, improved fringe-rate filtering, and updated power-spectral analysis using optimal quadratic estimators. The result is a new 2 {\"I} upper limit on {\^I} 2 ( k ) of (22.4 mK) 2 in the range ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0004-637X/809/1/61/apj517488ieqn1.gif] {$0.15\lt k\lt 0.5h\;{\mathrm{Mpc}}^{-1}$} at z = 8.4. This represents a three-fold improvement over the previous best upper limit. As we discuss in more depth in a forthcoming paper, this upper limit supports and extends previous evidence against extremely cold reionization scenarios. We conclude with a discussion of implications for future 21 cm reionization experiments, including the newly funded Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array.},

	Abstract = {A new digital backend has been developed for the Basic Element for SKA Training II (BEST-2) array at Radiotelescopi di Medicina, INAF-IRA, Italy, which allows concurrent operation of an FX correlator, and a direct-imaging correlator and beamformer. This backend serves as a platform for testing some of the spatial Fourier transform concepts which have been proposed for use in computing correlations on regularly gridded arrays. While spatial Fourier transform-based beamformers have been implemented previously, this is, to our knowledge, the first time a direct-imaging correlator has been deployed on a radio astronomy array. Concurrent observations with the FX and direct-imaging correlator allow for direct comparison between the two architectures. Additionally, we show the potential of the direct-imaging correlator for time-domain astronomy, by passing a subset of beams though a pulsar and transient detection pipeline. These results provide a timely verification for spatial Fourier transform-based instruments that are currently in commissioning. These instruments aim to detect highly redshifted hydrogen from the epoch of reionization and/or to perform wide-field surveys for time-domain studies of the radio sky. We experimentally show the direct-imaging correlator architecture to be a viable solution for correlation and beamforming.},

	Abstract = {We introduce 21 CMMC: a parallelized, Monte Carlo Markov Chain analysis tool, incorporating the epoch of reionization (EoR) seminumerical simulation 21 CMFAST. 21 CMMC estimates astrophysical parameter constraints from 21 cm EoR experiments, accommodating a variety of EoR models, as well as priors on model parameters and the reionization history. To illustrate its utility, we consider two different EoR scenarios, one with a single population of galaxies
(with a mass-independent ionizing efficiency) and a second, more general model with two different, feedback-regulated populations (each with mass-dependent ionizing efficiencies). As an example, combining three observations (z = 8, 9 and 10) of the 21 cm power spectrum with a conservative noise estimate and uniform model priors, we find that interferometers with specifications like the Low Frequency Array/Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array (HERA)/Square Kilometre Array 1 (SKA1) can constrain common reionization parameters: the ionizing efficiency (or similarly the escape fraction), the mean free path of ionizing photons and the log of the minimum virial temperature of star-forming haloes to within 45.3/22.0/16.7, 33.5/18.4/17.8 and 6.3/3.3/2.4 per cent, ∼1σ fractional uncertainty, respectively. Instead, if we optimistically assume that we can perfectly characterize the EoR modelling uncertainties, we can improve on these constraints by up to a factor of ∼few. Similarly, the fractional uncertainty on the average neutral fraction can be constrained to within ≲ 10 per cent for HERA and SKA1. By studying the resulting impact on astrophysical constraints, 21 CMMC can be used to optimize (i) interferometer designs; (ii) foreground cleaning algorithms; (iii) observing strategies; (iv) alternative statistics characterizing the 21 cm signal; and (v) synergies with other observational programs.},

	Abstract = {An 8 X 8 equals 64 element digital interferometer was developed at Waseda University (1989 - 1995). It was an equally spaced two dimensional array of 2.4 m dishes at 10.6 GHz, and a 2D FFT processor was used for Nyquist rate imaging. Recently a spatial-temporal (2 + 1)D FFT processor has been developed for pulsar survey (1996 - 2000), in which a first 2D spatial FFT transforms the electric fields of coordinate represented to those of momentum represented. We obtain the electric fields in each 64 direction at Nyquist rate by the 2D spatial Fourier transform. The following temporal 1D FFT gives the spectrum of 64ch or 256ch to 64 directions respectively also at Nyquist rate. The total bandwidths of each direction are 20 MHz and the resulting frequency resolutions are 20/64 MHz or 20/256 MHz. For sensitive pulsar survey, we also have developed an interferometric array of 20 m spherical dishes in Nasu flat, 160 km north of Tokyo. Five dishes are completed at present. Normal temperature receivers of high electron mobility transistors (HEMT) are used at 1.4 GHz observation and the receiver noise temperatures are below 40 K. Expected rms detection limit (Delta) T is about 10-2K under the condition of 20 MHz band widths and 1s integration time. Preliminary results of zenith survey at (delta) equals 40 deg using a single dish show (Delta) T equals 0.03 K without switching. Sub-reflectors and feed horns were designed so as to observe 5 deg off directions from zenith and they rotate around Az axis. It enable us to survey the declination zone of 32 &lt;EQ (delta) &lt;EQ 42 deg.},

We investigate the signatures of wide-field measurements and an all-sky foreground model using the delay spectrum technique that maps the measurements to foreground object locations through signal delays between antenna pairs. We demonstrate interferometric measurements are inherently sensitive to all scales, including the largest angular scales, owing to the nature of wide-field measurements. These wide-field effects are generic to all observations but antenna shapes impact their amplitudes substantially. A dish-shaped antenna yields the most desirable features from a foreground contamination viewpoint, relative to a dipole or a phased array. Comparing data from recent Murchison Widefield Array observations, we demonstrate that the foreground signatures that have the largest impact on the H i signal arise from power received far away from the primary field of view. We identify diffuse emission near the horizon as a significant contributing factor, even on wide antenna spacings that usually represent structures on small scales. For signals entering through the primary field of view, compact emission dominates the foreground contamination. These two mechanisms imprint a characteristic pitchfork signature on the ``foreground wedge'' in Fourier delay space. Based on these results, we propose that selective down-weighting of data based on antenna spacing and time can mitigate foreground contamination substantially by a factor of ∼100 with negligible loss of sensitivity.},

	Abstract = {We confirm our recent prediction of the ``pitchfork'' foreground signature in power spectra of high-redshift 21 cm measurements where the interferometer is sensitive to large-scale structure on all baselines. This is due to the inherent response of a wide-field instrument and is characterized by enhanced power from foreground emission in Fourier modes adjacent to those considered to be the most sensitive to the cosmological H i signal. In our recent paper, many signatures from the simulation that predicted this feature were validated against Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) data, but this key pitchfork signature was close to the noise level. In this paper, we improve the data sensitivity through the coherent averaging of 12 independent snapshots with identical instrument settings and provide the first confirmation of the prediction with a signal-to-noise ratio ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/2041-8205/807/2/L28/apjl516554ieqn1.gif] {$\gt 10$} . This wide-field effect can be mitigated by careful antenna designs that suppress sensitivity near the horizon. Simple models for antenna apertures that have been proposed for future instruments such as the Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array and the Square Kilometre Array indicate they should suppress foreground leakage from the pitchfork by ∼40 dB relative to the MWA and significantly increase the likelihood of cosmological signal detection in these critical Fourier modes in the three-dimensional power spectrum.},

	Abstract = { ABSTRACT The Murchison Widefield Array is a new low-frequency interferometric radio telescope built in Western Australia at one of the locations of the future Square Kilometre Array. We describe the automated radio-frequency interference detection strategy implemented for the Murchison Widefield Array, which is based on the aoflagger platform, and present 72--231 MHz radio-frequency interference statistics from 10 observing nights. Radio-frequency interference detection removes 1.1% of the data. Radio-frequency interference from digital TV is observed 3% of the time due to occasional ionospheric or atmospheric propagation. After radio-frequency interference detection and excision, almost all data can be calibrated and imaged without further radio-frequency interference mitigation efforts, including observations within the FM and digital TV bands. The results are compared to a previously published Low-Frequency Array radio-frequency interference survey. The remote location of the Murchison Widefield Array results in a substantially cleaner radio-frequency interference environment compared to Low-Frequency Array's radio environment, but adequate detection of radio-frequency interference is still required before data can be analysed. We include specific recommendations designed to make the Square Kilometre Array more robust to radio-frequency interference, including: the availability of sufficient computing power for radio-frequency interference detection; accounting for radio-frequency interference in the receiver design; a smooth band-pass response; and the capability of radio-frequency interference detection at high time and frequency resolution (second and kHz-scale respectively). },

	Abstract = {Infrared and radio observations of the Epoch of Reionization promise to revolutionize our understanding of the cosmic dawn, and major efforts with the JWST , MWA, and HERA are underway. While measurements of the ionizing sources with infrared telescopes and the effect of these sources on the intergalactic medium with radio telescopes should be complementary, to date the wildly disparate angular resolutions and survey speeds have made connecting proposed observations difficult. In this paper we develop a method to bridge the gap between radio and infrared studies. While the radio images may not have the sensitivity and resolution to identify individual bubbles with high fidelity, by leveraging knowledge of the measured power spectrum we are able to separate regions that are likely ionized from largely neutral, providing context for the JWST observations of galaxy counts and properties in each. By providing the ionization context for infrared galaxy observations, this method can significantly enhance the science returns of JWST and other infrared observations.},

Our calculation takes into account synthesis rotation, chromatic and asymmetrical baseline effects, and excludes modes that will be contaminated by foreground subtraction. For the fiducial model, the MWA will be capable of a 14σ detection of the EoR signal with one full season of observation on two fields (900 and 700 h).},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT. Proposed 21 cm cosmology observatories for studying the epoch of reionization (  ≈ 6--15 ) and dark energy (  ≈ 0--6 ) envision compact arrays with tens of thousands of antenna elements. Fully correlating this many elements is computationally expensive using traditional XF or FX correlators and has led some groups to reconsider direct imaging/FFT correlators. In this article we develop a variation of the direct imaging correlator that we call the MOFF correlator. The MOFF correlator shares the computational advantages of a direct imaging correlator, while avoiding a number of its shortcomings. In particular, the MOFF correlator makes no constraints on the antenna arrangement or type; provides a fully calibrated output image, including wide-field polarimetry and noncoplanar baseline effects; and can be orders of magnitude more efficient than XF or FX correlators for compact radio cosmology arrays.},

Our code generates 3D realizations of evolved density, ionization, peculiar velocity and spin temperature fields, which it then combines to compute the 21-cm brightness temperature. Although the physical processes are treated with approximate methods, we compare our results to a state-of-the-art large-scale hydrodynamic simulation, and find good agreement on scales pertinent to the upcoming observations (≳1 Mpc). The power spectra from 21cmfast agree with those generated from the numerical simulation to within 10s of per cent, down to the Nyquist frequency. We show results from a 1-Gpc simulation which tracks the cosmic 21-cm signal down from z= 250, highlighting the various interesting epochs. Depending on the desired resolution, 21cmfast can compute a redshift realization on a single processor in just a few minutes. Our code is fast, efficient, customizable and publicly available, making it a useful tool for 21-cm parameter studies.},

	Abstract = {Recently, there has been a great deal of interest in understanding the reionization of hydrogen in the intergalactic medium (IGM). One of the major outstanding questions is how this event proceeds on large scales. Motivated by numerical simulations, we develop a model for the growth of H II regions during the reionization era. We associate ionized regions with large-scale density fluctuations and use the excursion set formalism to model the resulting size distribution. We then consider ways in which to characterize the morphology of ionized regions. We show how to construct the power spectrum of fluctuations in the neutral hydrogen field. The power spectrum contains definite features from the H II regions that should be observable with the next generation of low-frequency radio telescopes through surveys of redshifted 21 cm emission from the reionization era. Finally, we also consider statistical descriptions beyond the power spectrum and show that our model of reionization qualitatively changes the distribution of neutral gas in the IGM.},

	Abstract = {A number of experiments are currently working toward a measurement of the 21 cm signal from the epoch of reionization (EoR). Whether or not these experiments deliver a detection of cosmological emission, their limited sensitivity will prevent them from providing detailed information about the astrophysics of reionization. In this work, we consider what types of measurements will be enabled by the next generation of larger 21 cm EoR telescopes. To calculate the type of constraints that will be possible with such arrays, we use simple models for the instrument, foreground emission, and the reionization history. We focus primarily on an instrument modeled after the ~0.1 km 2 collecting area Hydrogen Epoch of Reionization Array concept design and parameterize the uncertainties with regard to foreground emission by considering different limits to the recently described "wedge" footprint in k space. Uncertainties in the reionization history are accounted for using a series of simulations that vary the ionizing efficiency and minimum virial temperature of the galaxies responsible for reionization, as well as the mean free path of ionizing photons through the intergalactic medium. Given various combinations of models, we consider the significance of the possible power spectrum detections, the ability to trace the power spectrum evolution versus redshift, the detectability of salient power spectrum features, and the achievable level of quantitative constraints on astrophysical parameters. Ultimately, we find that 0.1 km 2 of collecting area is enough to ensure a very high significance ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 30σ) detection of the reionization power spectrum in even the most pessimistic scenarios. This sensitivity should allow for meaningful constraints on the reionization history and astrophysical parameters, especially if foreground subtraction techniques can be improved and successfully implemented.},

	Abstract = {We are developing the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Re-ionization (PAPER) to detect 21 cm emission from the early universe, when the first stars and galaxies were forming. We describe the overall experiment strategy and architecture and summarize two PAPER deployments: a four-antenna array in the low radio frequency interference (RFI) environment of Western Australia and an eight-antenna array at a prototyping site at the NRAO facilities near Green Bank, WV. From these activities we report on system performance, including primary beam model verification, dependence of system gain on ambient temperature, measurements of receiver and overall system temperatures, and characterization of the RFI environment at each deployment site. We present an all-sky map synthesized between 139 MHz and 174 MHz using data from both arrays that reaches down to 80 mJy (4.9 K, for a beam size of 2.15e--5 sr at 156 MHz), with a 10 mJy (620 mK) thermal noise level that indicates what would be achievable with better foreground subtraction. We calculate angular power spectra ( C ℓ ) in a cold patch and determine them to be dominated by point sources, but with contributions from galactic synchrotron emission at lower radio frequencies and angular wavemodes. Although the sample variance of foregrounds dominates errors in these power spectra, we measure a thermal noise level of 310 mK at ℓ = 100 for a 1.46 MHz band centered at 164.5 MHz. This sensitivity level is approximately 3 orders of magnitude in temperature above the level of the fluctuations in 21 cm emission associated with re-ionization.},

	Abstract = {The Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope Epoch of Reionization experiment is an ongoing effort to measure the power spectrum from neutral hydrogen at high redshift. We have previously reported an upper limit of (70 mK)2 at wavenumbers of k ≈ 0.65 h Mpc−1 using a basic piecewise-linear foreground subtraction. In this paper, we explore the use of a singular value decomposition to remove foregrounds with fewer assumptions about the foreground structure. Using this method, we also quantify, for the first time, the signal loss due to the foreground filter and present new power spectra adjusted for this loss, providing a revised measurement of a 2σ upper limit at (248 mK)2 for k = 0.50 h Mpc−1. While this revised limit is larger than previously reported, we believe it to be more robust and still represents the best current constraint on reionization at z ≈ 8.6.},

	Abstract = {We describe and compare several post-correlation radio frequency interference (RFI) classification methods. As data sizes of observations grow with new and improved telescopes, the need for completely automated, robust methods for RFI mitigation is pressing. We investigated several classification methods and find that, for the data sets we used, the most accurate among them is the SumThreshold method. This is a new method formed from a combination of existing techniques, including a new way of thresholding. This iterative method estimates the astronomical signal by carrying out a surface fit in the time-frequency plane. With a theoretical accuracy of 95 per cent recognition and an approximately 0.1 per cent false probability rate in simple simulated cases, the method is in practice as good as the human eye in finding RFI. In addition, it is fast, robust, does not need a data model before it can be executed and works in almost all configurations with its default parameters. The method has been compared using simulated data with several other mitigation techniques, including one based upon the singular value decomposition of the time-frequency matrix, and has shown better results than the rest.},

@article{Jacobs:2013,
	Abstract = {We present a catalog of spectral measurements covering a 100-200 MHz band for 32 sources, derived from observations with a 64 antenna deployment of the Donald C. Backer Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization (PAPER) in South Africa. For transit telescopes such as PAPER, calibration of the primary beam is a difficult endeavor and errors in this calibration are a major source of error in the determination of source spectra. In order to decrease our reliance on an accurate beam calibration, we focus on calibrating sources in a narrow declination range from --46$\,^{\circ}$ to --40$\,^{\circ}$. Since sources at similar declinations follow nearly identical paths through the primary beam, this restriction greatly reduces errors associated with beam calibration, yielding a dramatic improvement in the accuracy of derived source spectra. Extrapolating from higher frequency catalogs, we derive the flux scale using a Monte Carlo fit across multiple sources that includes uncertainty from both catalog and measurement errors. Fitting spectral models to catalog data and these new PAPER measurements, we derive new flux models for Pictor A and 31 other sources at nearby declinations; 90% are found to confirm and refine a power-law model for flux density. Of particular importance is the new Pictor A flux model, which is accurate to 1.4% and shows that between 100 MHz and 2 GHz, in contrast with previous models, the spectrum of Pictor A is consistent with a single power law given by a flux at 150 MHz of 382 $\pm$ 5.4 Jy and a spectral index of --0.76 $\pm$ 0.01. This accuracy represents an order of magnitude improvement over previous measurements in this band and is limited by the uncertainty in the catalog measurements used to estimate the absolute flux scale. The simplicity and improved accuracy of Pictor A's spectrum make it an excellent calibrator in a band important for experiments seeking to measure 21 cm emission from the epoch of reionization.},

	Abstract = {We present new observations with the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization with the aim of measuring the properties of foreground emission for 21 cm epoch of reionization (EoR) experiments at 150 MHz. We focus on the footprint of the foregrounds in cosmological Fourier space to understand which modes of the 21 cm power spectrum will most likely be compromised by foreground emission. These observations confirm predictions that foregrounds can be isolated to a "wedge"-like region of two-dimensional ( k ⊥ , k ∥ )-space, creating a window for cosmological studies at higher k ∥ values. We also find that the emission extends past the nominal edge of this wedge due to spectral structure in the foregrounds, with this feature most prominent on the shortest baselines. Finally, we filter the data to retain only this "unsmooth" emission and image its specific k ∥ modes. The resultant images show an excess of power at the lowest modes, but no emission can be clearly localized to any one region of the sky. This image is highly suggestive that the most problematic foregrounds for 21 cm EoR studies will not be easily identifiable bright sources, but rather an aggregate of fainter emission.},

Foreground source removal is one of the principal challenges for the detection of this signal. This paper investigates the extragalactic point source contamination and how accurately bright sources ( ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 1 Jy) must be removed in order to detect 21 cm emission with upcoming radio telescopes such as the Murchison Widefield Array. We consider the residual contamination in 21 cm maps and power spectra due to position errors in the sky model for bright sources, as well as frequency-independent calibration errors. We find that a source position accuracy of 0.1 arcsec will suffice for detection of the H I power spectrum. For calibration errors, 0.05% accuracy in antenna gain amplitude is required in order to detect the cosmic signal. Both sources of subtraction error produce residuals that are localized to small angular scales, k ⊥ ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gsim.gif] {gsim} 0.05 Mpc --1 , in the two-dimensional power spectrum.},

	Abstract = {21-cm tomography is expected to be difficult in part because of serious foreground contamination. Previous studies have found that line-of-sight approaches are capable of cleaning foregrounds to an acceptable level on large spatial scales, but not on small spatial scales. In this paper, we introduce a Fourier space formalism for describing the line-of-sight methods, and use it to introduce an improved new method for 21-cm foreground cleaning. Heuristically, this method involves fitting foregrounds in Fourier space using weighted polynomial fits, with each pixel weighted according to its information content. We show that the new method reproduces the old one on large angular scales, and gives marked improvements on small scales at essentially no extra computational cost.},

	Abstract = {21-cm tomography is emerging as a promising probe of the cosmological dark ages and the epoch of reionization, as well as a tool for observational cosmology in general. However, serious sources of foreground contamination must be subtracted for experimental efforts to be viable. In this paper, we focus on the removal of unresolved extragalactic point sources with smooth spectra, and evaluate how the residual foreground contamination after cleaning depends on instrumental and algorithmic parameters. A crucial but often ignored complication is that the synthesized beam of an interferometer array shrinks towards higher frequency, causing complicated frequency structure in each sky pixel as `frizz' far from the beam centre contracts across unresolved radio sources. We find that current-generation experiments should none the less be able to clean out this point source contamination adequately, and quantify the instrumental and algorithmic design specifications required to meet this foreground challenge.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we explore for the first time the relative magnitudes of three fundamental sources of uncertainty, namely, foreground contamination, thermal noise, and sample variance, in detecting the H I power spectrum from the epoch of reionization (EoR). We derive limits on the sensitivity of a Fourier synthesis telescope to detect EoR based on its array configuration and a statistical representation of images made by the instrument. We use the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) configuration for our studies. Using a unified framework for estimating signal and noise components in the H I power spectrum, we derive an expression for and estimate the contamination from extragalactic point-like sources in three-dimensional k -space. Sensitivity for EoR H I power spectrum detection is estimated for different observing modes with MWA. With 1000 hr of observing on a single field using the 128 tile MWA, EoR detection is feasible (S/N >1 for k ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 0.8 Mpc --1 ). Bandpass shaping and refinements to the EoR window are found to be effective in containing foreground contamination, which makes the instrument tolerant to imaging errors. We find that for a given observing time, observing many independent fields of view does not offer an advantage over a single field observation when thermal noise dominates over other uncertainties in the derived power spectrum.},

@article{Wyithe:2007,
	Abstract = {Spatial dependence in the statistics of redshifted 21-cm fluctuations promises to provide the most powerful probe of the reionization epoch. In this paper we consider the second and third moments of the redshifted 21-cm intensity distribution using a simple model that accounts for galaxy bias during the reionization process. We demonstrate that skewness in redshifted 21-cm maps should be substantial throughout the reionization epoch and on all angular scales, owing to the effects of galaxy bias which leads to early reionization in overdense regions of the intergalactic medium (IGM). The variance (or power spectrum) of 21-cm fluctuations will exhibit a minimum in redshift part way through the reionization process, when the global ionization fraction is around 50 per cent. This minimum is generic, and is due to the transition from 21-cm intensity being dominated by overdense to underdense regions as reionization progresses. We show that the details of the reionization history, including the presence of radiative feedback are encoded in the evolution of the autocorrelation and skewness functions with redshift and mean IGM neutral fraction. The amplitudes of fluctuations are particularly sensitive to the masses of ionizing sources, and vary by an order of magnitude for astrophysically plausible models. We discuss the detection of skewness by first-generation instruments, and conclude that the Mileura Wide-field Array--Low-Frequency Demonstrator will have sufficient sensitivity to detect skewness on a range of angular scales at redshifts near the end of reionization, while a subsequent instrument of 10 times the collecting area could map out the evolution of skewness in detail. The observation of a minimum in variance during the reionization history, and the detection of skewness would both provide important confirmation of the cosmological origin of redshifted 21-cm intensity fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {We present results from a large volume simulation of hydrogen reionization. We combine 3D radiative transfer calculations and an N -body simulation, describing structure formation in the intergalactic medium, to detail the growth of H II regions around high-redshift galaxies. Our simulation tracks 1024 3 dark matter particles, in a box of comoving side length 65.6 Mpc h -1 . This large volume allows us to accurately characterize the size distribution of H II regions throughout most of the reionization process. At the same time, our simulation resolves many of the small galaxies likely responsible for reionization. It confirms a picture anticipated by analytic models: H II regions grow collectively around highly clustered sources and have a well-defined characteristic size, which evolves from a sub-Mpc scale at the beginning of reionization to R > 10 Mpc toward the end. We present a detailed statistical description of our results and compare them with a numerical scheme based on the analytic model by Furlanetto and coworkers. We find that the analytic calculation reproduces the size distribution of H II regions and the 21 cm power spectrum of the radiative transfer simulation remarkably well. The ionization field from the simulation, however, has more small-scale structure than the analytic calculation, owing to Poisson scatter in the simulated abundance of galaxies on small scales. We propose and validate a simple scheme to incorporate this scatter into our calculations. Our results suggest that analytic calculations are sufficiently accurate to aid in predicting and interpreting the results of future 21 cm surveys. In particular, our fast numerical scheme is useful for forecasting constraints from future 21 cm surveys and in constructing mock surveys to test data analysis procedures.},

	Abstract = {One of the most promising approaches for studying reionization is to use the redshifted 21 cm line. Early generations of redshifted 21 cm surveys will not, however, have the sensitivity to make detailed maps of the reionization process, and will instead focus on statistical measurements. Here, we show that it may nonetheless be possible to directly identify ionized regions in upcoming data sets by applying suitable filters to the noisy data. The locations of prominent minima in the filtered data correspond well with the positions of ionized regions. In particular, we corrupt semi-numeric simulations of the redshifted 21 cm signal during reionization with thermal noise at the level expected for a 500 antenna tile version of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA), and mimic the degrading effects of foreground cleaning. Using a matched filter technique, we find that the MWA should be able to directly identify ionized regions despite the large thermal noise. In a plausible fiducial model in which ~20% of the volume of the universe is neutral at z ~ 7, we find that a 500-tile MWA may directly identify as many as ~150 ionized regions in a 6 MHz portion of its survey volume and roughly determine the size of each of these regions. This may, in turn, allow interesting multi-wavelength follow-up observations, comparing galaxy properties inside and outside of ionized regions. We discuss how the optimal configuration of radio antenna tiles for detecting ionized regions with a matched filter technique differs from the optimal design for measuring power spectra. These considerations have potentially important implications for the design of future redshifted 21 cm surveys.},

	Abstract = {Tomography of redshifted 21 cm transition from neutral hydrogen using Fourier synthesis telescopes is a promising tool to study the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). Limiting the confusion from Galactic and extragalactic foregrounds is critical to the success of these telescopes. The instrumental response or the point-spread function (PSF) of such telescopes is inherently three dimensional with frequency mapping to the line-of-sight (LOS) distance. EoR signals will necessarily have to be detected in data where continuum confusion persists; therefore, it is important that the PSF has acceptable frequency structure so that the residual foreground does not confuse the EoR signature. This paper aims to understand the three-dimensional PSF and foreground contamination in the same framework. We develop a formalism to estimate the foreground contamination along frequency, or equivalently LOS dimension, and establish a relationship between foreground contamination in the image plane and visibility weights on the Fourier plane. We identify two dominant sources of LOS foreground contamination{\^O}{\o}Ω"PSF contamination" and "gridding contamination." We show that PSF contamination is localized in LOS wavenumber space, beyond which there potentially exists an "EoR window" with negligible foreground contamination where we may focus our efforts to detect EoR. PSF contamination in this window may be substantially reduced by judicious choice of a frequency window function. Gridding and imaging algorithms create additional gridding contamination and we propose a new imaging algorithm using the Chirp Z Transform that significantly reduces this contamination. Finally, we demonstrate the analytical relationships and the merit of the new imaging algorithm for the case of imaging with the Murchison Widefield Array.},

	Abstract = {Precise subtraction of foreground sources is crucial for detecting and estimating 21 cm H I signals from the Epoch of Reionization (EoR). We quantify how imperfect point-source subtraction due to limitations of the measurement data set yields structured residual signal in the data set. We use the Cramer-Rao lower bound, as a metric for quantifying the precision with which a parameter may be measured, to estimate the residual signal in a visibility data set due to imperfect point-source subtraction. We then propagate these residuals into two metrics of interest for 21 cm EoR experiments‚{\"A}{\^\i}the angular power spectrum and two-dimensional power spectrum‚{\"A}{\^\i}using a combination of full analytic covariant derivation, analytic variant derivation, and covariant Monte Carlo simulations. This methodology differs from previous work in two ways: (1) it uses information theory to set the point-source position error, rather than assuming a global rms error, and (2) it describes a method for propagating the errors analytically, thereby obtaining the full correlation structure of the power spectra. The methods are applied to two upcoming low-frequency instruments that are proposing to perform statistical EoR experiments: the Murchison Widefield Array and the Precision Array for Probing the Epoch of Reionization. In addition to the actual antenna configurations, we apply the methods to minimally redundant and maximally redundant configurations. We find that for peeling sources above 1 Jy, the amplitude of the residual signal, and its variance, will be smaller than the contribution from thermal noise for the observing parameters proposed for upcoming EoR experiments, and that optimal subtraction of bright point sources will not be a limiting factor for EoR parameter estimation. We then use the formalism to provide an ab initio analytic derivation motivating the "wedge" feature in the two-dimensional power spectrum, complementing previous discussion in the literature.},

	Abstract = {We present a new hybrid code for large-volume, high-resolution simulations of cosmic reionization, which utilizes an N -body algorithm for dark matter, physically motivated prescriptions for baryons and star formation, and an adaptive ray-tracing algorithm for radiative transfer of ionizing photons. Two test simulations, each with 3 billion particles and 400 million rays in a 50 Mpc h -1 box, have been run to give initial results. Halos are resolved down to virial temperatures of 10 4 K for the redshift range of interest in order to robustly model star formation and clumping factors. This is essential to correctly account for ionization and recombination processes. We find that the halos and sources are strongly biased with respect to the underlying dark matter, re-enforcing the requirement of large simulation boxes to minimize cosmic variance and to obtain a qualitatively correct picture of reionization. We model the stellar initial mass function (IMF) by following the spatially dependent gas metallicity evolution, and distinguish between the first generation, Population III (PopIII) stars and the second generation, Population II (PopII) stars. The PopIII stars with a top-heavy IMF produce an order of magnitude more ionizing photons at high redshifts z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/gtrsim.gif] {gtrsim} 10, resulting in a more extended reionization. In our simulations, complete overlap of H II regions occurs at z ≈ 6.5, and the computed mass- and volume-weighted residual H I fractions at 5 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} z ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lesssim.gif] {lesssim} 6.5 are both in good agreement with high-redshift quasar absorption measurements from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS).

@article{Morales:2005b,
	Abstract = {Recent theoretical developments concerning the plasma physics near the GRB blast wave have renewed interest in the properties of impulsive low frequency radio emission from GRBs. Prompt coherent low frequency radio emission would provide a unique probe of the plasma conditions near the blast wave during the period of peak particle acceleration and gamma ray emission. In this paper we introduce the GRB All-sky Spectrometer Experiment (GASE). This experiment will make use of advances in digital technology to record 4 MHz of bandwidth in eight 30 MHz dipole antennas for two hours after a Swift or HETE-2 trigger is received. Due to the long dispersion delay at low frequencies, this allows contemporaneous measurements of the gamma ray and radio emission. The high spectral resolution of GASE will allow the predicted prompt 30 MHz signal from GRBs to be fully de-dispersed and identified. The combination of high spectral resolution, full-sky imaging, and (if required) geographically separated detectors will also provide stringent rejection of radio interference.},

	Abstract = {Statistical observations of the epoch of reionization using the 21 cm line of neutral hydrogen have the potential to revolutionize our understanding of structure formation and the first luminous objects. However, these observations are complicated by a host of strong foreground sources. Several foreground-removal techniques have been proposed in the literature, and it has been assumed that these would be used in combination to reveal the epoch of reionization (EOR) signal. By studying the characteristic subtraction errors of the proposed foreground-removal techniques, we identify an additional subtraction stage that can further reduce the EOR foreground contamination, and study the interactions between the foreground-removal algorithms. This enables us to outline a comprehensive foreground-removal strategy that incorporates all previously proposed subtraction techniques. Using this foreground-removal framework and the characteristic subtraction errors, we discuss the complementarity of different foreground-removal techniques and the implications for array design and the analysis of EOR data.},

	Abstract = {ABSTRACT
We present a method for subtracting point sources from interferometric radio images via forward modelling of the instrument response and involving an algebraic non-linear minimization. The method is applied to simulated maps of the Murchison Wide-field Array but is generally useful in cases where only image data are available. After source subtraction, the residual maps have no statistical difference to the expected thermal noise distribution at all angular scales, indicating high effectiveness in the subtraction. Simulations indicate that the errors in recovering the source parameters decrease with increasing signal-to-noise ratio, which is consistent with the theoretical measurement errors. In applying the technique to simulated snapshot observations with the Murchison Wide-field Array, we found that all 101 sources present in the simulation were recovered with an average position error of 10 arcsec and an average flux density error of 0.15 per cent. This led to a dynamic range increase of approximately 3 orders of magnitude. Since all the sources were deconvolved jointly, the subtraction was not limited by source sidelobes but by thermal noise. This technique is a promising deconvolution method for upcoming radio arrays with a huge number of elements and a candidate for the difficult task of subtracting foreground sources from observations of the 21-cm neutral hydrogen signal from the epoch of reionization.},

We propose a method to separate these components based on the angular dependence of the 21 cm fluctuation power spectrum. Peculiar velocities increase the power spectrum by a factor of ~2 compared with density fluctuations alone and introduce an angular dependence in Fourier space. The resulting angular structure relative to the line of sight facilitates a simple separation of the power spectrum into several components, permitting an unambiguous determination of the primordial power spectrum of density fluctuations, and of the detailed properties of all astrophysical sources of 21 cm fluctuations. We also demonstrate that angular multipoles are not useful for measuring large-scale power, and thus, theoretical predictions should focus on the three-dimensional power spectrum of 21 cm fluctuations.},

	Abstract = {Antenna layout is an important design consideration for radio interferometers because it determines the quality of the snapshot point spread function (PSF, or array beam). This is particularly true for experiments targeting the 21-cm Epoch of Reionization signal as the quality of the foreground subtraction depends directly on the spatial dynamic range and thus the smoothness of the baseline distribution. Nearly all sites have constraints on where antennas can be placed -- even at the remote Australian location of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) there are rock outcrops, flood zones, heritages areas, emergency runways and trees. These exclusion areas can introduce spatial structure into the baseline distribution that enhances the PSF sidelobes and reduces the angular dynamic range. In this paper we present a new method of constrained antenna placement that reduces the spatial structure in the baseline distribution. This method not only outperforms random placement algorithms that avoid exclusion zones, but surprisingly outperforms random placement algorithms without constraints to provide what we believe are the smoothest constrained baseline distributions developed to date. We use our new algorithm to determine antenna placements for the originally planned MWA, and present the antenna locations, baseline distribution and snapshot PSF for this array choice.},

In this paper we provide the first quantitative calculation of the three-dimensional power spectrum sensitivity, incorporating the design parameters of a planned array.

	Abstract = {Subtraction of astrophysical foreground contamination from "dirty" sky maps produced by simulated measurements of the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) has been performed by fitting a third-order polynomial along the spectral dimension of each pixel in the data cubes. The simulations are the first to include the unavoidable instrumental effects of the frequency-dependent primary antenna beams and synthesized array beams. They recover the one-dimensional spherically binned input redshifted 21 cm power spectrum within ~1% over the scales probed most sensitively by the MWA (0.01 ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} k ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 1 Mpc �1 ) and demonstrate that realistic instrumental effects will not mask the epoch of reionization signal. We find that the weighting function used to produce the dirty sky maps from the gridded visibility measurements is important to the success of the technique. Uniform weighting of the visibility measurements produces the best results, whereas natural weighting significantly worsens the foreground subtraction by coupling structure in the density of the visibility measurements to spectral structure in the dirty sky map data cube. The extremely dense uv -coverage of the MWA was found to be advantageous for this technique and produced very good results on scales corresponding to | u | ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/icons/Entities/lsim.gif] {lsim} 500? in the uv -plane without any selective editing of the uv -coverage.},

	Abstract = {The combination of seven-year data from WMAP and improved astrophysical data rigorously tests the standard cosmological model and places new constraints on its basic parameters and extensions. By combining the WMAP data with the latest distance measurements from the baryon acoustic oscillations (BAO) in the distribution of galaxies and the Hubble constant ( H 0 ) measurement, we determine the parameters of the simplest six-parameter ?CDM model. The power-law index of the primordial power spectrum is n s = 0.968 � 0.012 (68% CL) for this data combination, a measurement that excludes the Harrison-Zel'dovich-Peebles spectrum by 99.5% CL. The other parameters, including those beyond the minimal set, are also consistent with, and improved from, the five-year results. We find no convincing deviations from the minimal model. The seven-year temperature power spectrum gives a better determination of the third acoustic peak, which results in a better determination of the redshift of the matter-radiation equality epoch. Notable examples of improved parameters are the total mass of neutrinos, � m ? < 0.58 eV(95%CL), and the effective number of neutrino species, N eff = 4.34 +0.86 �0.88 (68% CL), which benefit from better determinations of the third peak and H 0 . The limit on a constant dark energy equation of state parameter from WMAP +BAO+ H 0 , without high-redshift Type Ia supernovae, is w = �1.10 � 0.14 (68% CL). We detect the effect of primordial helium on the temperature power spectrum and provide a new test of big bang nucleosynthesis by measuring Y p = 0.326 � 0.075 (68% CL). We detect, and show on the map for the first time, the tangential and radial polarization patterns around hot and cold spots of temperature fluctuations, an important test of physical processes at z = 1090 and the dominance of adiabatic scalar fluctuations. The seven-year polarization data have significantly improved: we now detect the temperature- E -mode polarization cross power spectrum at 21?, compared with 13? from the five-year data. With the seven-year temperature- B -mode cross power spectrum, the limit on a rotation of the polarization plane due to potential parity-violating effects has improved by 38% to ##IMG## [http://ej.iop.org/images/0067-0049/192/2/18/apjs374858ieqn1.gif] {$\Delta \alpha =-1\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ $}1\pm 1\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ $}4 (\rm statistical)\pm 1\mbox{$.\!\!^\circ $}5 (\rm systematic)$} (68% CL). We report significant detections of the Sunyaev-Zel'dovich (SZ) effect at the locations of known clusters of galaxies. The measured SZ signal agrees well with the expected signal from the X-ray data on a cluster-by-cluster basis. However, it is a factor of 0.5-0.7 times the predictions from "universal profile" of Arnaud et al., analytical models, and hydrodynamical simulations. We find, for the first time in the SZ effect, a significant difference between the cooling-flow and non-cooling-flow clusters (or relaxed and non-relaxed clusters), which can explain some of the discrepancy. This lower amplitude is consistent with the lower-than-theoretically expected SZ power spectrum recently measured by the South Pole Telescope Collaboration.},

	Abstract = {We forecast the sensitivity with which the Murchison Widefield Array (MWA) can measure the 21 cm power spectrum of cosmic hydrogen. The MWA is sensitive to roughly a decade in scale (wavenumbers of k~0.1-1 h Mpc-1). This amounts primarily to constraints on two numbers: the amplitude and the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum on the scales probed. We find, however, that the redshift evolution in these quantities can yield important information about reionization. We examine a range of theoretical models, spanning uncertainties in the nature of the ionizing sources and the abundance of minihalos during reionization. Although the power spectrum differs substantially among these models, a generic prediction is that the amplitude of the 21 cm power spectrum on MWA scales (k~0.4 h Mpc-1) peaks near the epoch when the intergalactic medium (IGM) is ~50% ionized. Moreover, the slope of the 21 cm power spectrum flattens as the ionization fraction increases and the sizes of the H II regions grow. With regards to detection sensitivity, we show that the optimal MWA antenna configuration for power spectrum measurements would pack all 500 antenna tiles as closely as possible in a compact core. Detecting the characteristic redshift evolution of our models will help to confirm that observed 21 cm fluctuations originate from the IGM, and not from foregrounds, and will provide an indirect constraint on the evolution of the volume-filling factor of H II regions during reionization. After two years of observations, the MWA can constrain the filling factor at an epoch when i>~0.5 to within roughly +/-δi>~0.1 at 2 σ confidence.},

	Abstract = {A number of radio interferometers are currently being planned or constructed to observe 21 cm emission from reionization. Not only will such measurements provide a detailed view of that epoch, but, since the 21 cm emission also traces the distribution of matter in the universe, this signal can be used to constrain cosmological parameters. The sensitivity of an interferometer to the cosmological information in the signal may depend on how precisely the angular dependence of the 21 cm three-dimensional power spectrum can be measured. Using an analytic model for reionization, we quantify all the effects that break the spherical symmetry of the three-dimensional 21 cm power spectrum. We find that upcoming observatories will be sensitive to the 21 cm signal over a wide range of scales, from larger than 100 to as small as 1 comoving Mpc. Next, we consider three methods to measure cosmological parameters from the signal: (1) direct fitting of the density power spectrum to the signal, (2) using only the velocity field fluctuations in the signal, and (3) looking at the signal at large enough scales that all fluctuations trace the density field. With the foremost method, the first generation of 21 cm observations should moderately improve existing constraints on cosmological parameters for certain low-redshift reionization scenarios, and a 2 yr observation with the second-generation interferometer MWA5000 in combination with the CMB telescope Planck could improve constraints on Ωw, Ωmh2, Ωbh2, Ων, ns, and αs. If the universe is substantially ionized by z~12 or if spin temperature fluctuations are important, we show that it will be difficult to place competitive constraints on cosmological parameters with any of the considered methods.},

@article{Morales:2004,
	Abstract = {This paper explores the potential for statistical epoch of reionization (EOR) measurements using wide-field radio observations. New developments in low-frequency radio instrumentation and signal processing allow very sensitive EOR measurements, and the analysis techniques enabled by these advances offer natural ways of separating the EOR signal from the residual foreground emission. This paper introduces the enabling technologies and proposes an analysis technique designed to make optimal use of the capabilities of next-generation low-frequency radio arrays. The observations we propose can directly observe the power spectrum of the EOR using relatively short observations and are significantly more sensitive than other techniques that have been discussed in the literature. For example, in the absence of foreground contamination the measurements we propose would produce five 3 σ power spectrum points in 100 hr of observation with only 4 MHz bandwidth with LOFAR for simple models of the high-redshift 21 cm emission. The challenge of residual foreground removal may be addressed by the symmetries in the three-dimensional (two spatial frequencies and radio frequency) radio interferometric data. These symmetries naturally separate the EOR signal from most classes of residual unsubtracted foreground contamination, including all foreground continuum sources and radio line emission from the Milky Way.},

@article{Morales:2005,
	Abstract = {Recent theoretical developments for observing the epoch of reionization (EOR) have concentrated on the power spectrum signature of redshifted 21 cm emission. These studies have demonstrated the great potential of statistical EOR observations; however, the sensitivity calculations for proposed low-frequency radio arrays have been highly approximate. The formalism developed for interferometric measurements of the cosmic microwave background can be extended to three dimensions to naturally incorporate the line-of-sight information inherent in the EOR signal. In this paper we demonstrate how to accurately calculate the EOR power spectrum sensitivity of an array and develop scaling relationships that can be used to guide the design of EOR observatories. The implications for antenna distribution, antenna size, and correlator requirements on the EOR sensitivity are detailed.},

	Abstract = {Contamination from instrumental effects interacting with bright astrophysical sources is the primary impediment to measuring Epoch of Reionization (EoR) and Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) 21 cm power spectra�an effect called mode mixing. In this paper, we identify four fundamental power spectrum shapes produced by mode mixing that will affect all upcoming observations. We are able, for the first time, to explain the wedge-like structure seen in advanced simulations and to forecast the shape of an "EoR window" that is mostly free of contamination. Understanding the origins of these contaminations also enables us to identify calibration and foreground subtraction errors below the imaging limit, providing a powerful new tool for precision observations.},
